# JavaScript at Groupon

This repository contains tools & guidelines for using JavaScript at Groupon.
It represents a best effort to capture the current practices.

## Writing NPM Packages

### ES5 or ES2015?

The general rule is:
When writing code that is distributed via npm, we use ES5 code.
All libraries should use `groupon-es5`.
This ensures the code works consistently across all environments
and doesn't require any compilation.

There are exceptions when libraries depend on features like generators
that don't have a real ES5 equivalent.
But in most cases it's possible to isolate that code
into a separate library without polluting unrelated pieces of logic.

For client-side code using ES2015 and [proposed upcoming features](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262#ecmascript) like object spread is encouraged.
The default lint style should be `groupon` or `groupon-react` when using React.

For server-side code running on node 4.x/6.x or higher,
we try to restrict ourselves to the features that are natively supported.
This simplifies tooling and improves startup times.
The default lint style should be `groupon-node4`/`groupon-node6`.

### Versioning and Publishing

We use [`nlm`](https://github.com/groupon/nlm) to manage our libaries.
This ensures that:

1. Every library has a usable `CHANGELOG.md` file as part of its git history.
1. Releases are never tied to a single person.
1. We can easily share best practices across projects.

## Groupon JavaScript Style Guide

Fortunately there already is a great and well-documented style guide for JavaScript over at [airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
The short answer is: We stick to that.
There is no difference between the airbnb and the Groupon rules for anything but legacy/ES5 mode.

### The Longer Answer

#### Generally

##### `no-underscore-dangle`

Opinions on what "private state" means and how to use it vary.
The [Airbnb guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#naming--leading-underscore) comes down on the side of "if something can be inspected, it's not truly private".
We explicitly allow and even encourage the use of underscored properties for private state.

1. It's hard to define "can be inspected" in JavaScript, especially in node (there's always `vm.runInDebugContext`).
2. There's immense value in having private state inspectable while debugging certain issues.

We trust that users of libraries are aware that underscored properties are never part of the official interface
and changes to underscored properties are not considered breaking changes.

Using underscored properties outside of methods (e.g. not on `this`) is still considered an error.

##### Short Identifiers

The airbnb config allows identifiers of any length.
This doesn't mean we encourage a bunch of `x` and `y`s over meaningful names.
But there a situations where short identifiers are perfectly reasonable.

Examples:
* Mathematical functions like `(a, b) => a + b`
* Known shorthands like `_` for lodash or underscore (especially in legacy mode where destructuring isn't available)

When writing or reviewing code the rule of thumb is "clarity over brevity".
But a linter isn't in the best position to judge clarity.

#### `groupon-es5`

##### Strict Statements

We assume ES5 mode is used to lint code that will be running on node.js without any compilation steps.
Which means we enforce a top-level `'use strict'` statement.

##### Param reassignment is allowed

Because ES5 has no way to specify default parameters,
we allow param reassignment.
The following is allowed:

```js
function f(options) {
  options = options || {};
}
```

This should be limited to default parameters.
The following will pass the linter but should be avoided:

```js
function f(filename) {
  filename = path.resolve(process.cwd(), filename);
}
```

##### `var` not forced to top

We encourage keeping declaration and initialization close to each other.
Which means the following is allowed:

```js
function f() {
  var x = calcX();
  if (x <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  var y = calcY();
}
```

#### `coffeescript`

We include a single coffeelint config module - it allows globals appropriate for ES6, Mocha, and Node.JS coding.
