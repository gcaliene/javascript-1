# Groupon ESLint Styles for node 6.x

Groupon's coding guidelines for code that runs natively on node 6+.
This should only be used for app-level code
or code that is certain to never be used in a browser environment.

This is a thin wrapper around [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).
More info can be found at [groupon/javascript](https://github.com/groupon/javascript).
